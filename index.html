     <p>it's done! site should be working as intended now- s/o to the jazzy music customer service provided to me while i was tryna fix it.</p>
     
     <p>anyways, went out to get new figure skates today- they're tight but should wear in soon enough. they did music requests so i asked for <i>best to you</i> by <b>blood orange</b>, getting to live out a small dream of mine on the ice- the one from that clairo video where  they're all on roller skates. next time i just hope somehow it'll happen with the lights off in the rink.</p>

     <p>lonely day- gave up on something, started something else. gonna look for cassettes and something to record onto them with in the next couple days. looking foward to making some mixtapes of my favourite songs, and some great driving music. it'll be good to refine some of my huger playlists into my faves. spent the better parts of my day talking to my favourite people- and driving the new car, figuring it out. the seat goes alll the way back so that's got potential!</p>
     
     <p>was also thinking about the name of this site. i think it's definitely talking about someone specificly, but i've got a hunch that person will change over time. theres always gonna be someone you haven't talked to for a while, and that you miss. i guess i'll just accept that. i'm not gonna message them.</p>
