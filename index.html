     <p>it's done! site should be working as intended now- s/o to the jazzy music customer service provided to me while i was tryna fix it.</p>
     
     <p>anyways, went out to get new figure skates today- they're tight but should wear in soon enough. they did music requests so i asked for <i>Best To You</i> by <b>Blood Orange</b>, getting to live out a small dream of mine on the ice- the one from that clairo video where  they're all on roller skates. next time i just hope somehow it'll happen with the lights off in the rink.</p>

     <p>lonely day- gave up on something, started something else. gonna look for cassettes and something to record onto them with in the next couple days. looking foward to making some mixtapes of my favourite songs/genres/artists. it'll be good to refine some of my huger playlists into just my faves. spent the better parts of my day talking to my favourite people- and driving the new car, figuring it out. the seat goes alll the way back so that's got potential!</p>
     
     <p>was also thinking about the name of this site. i think it's definitely talking about someone specifically, but i've got a hunch that person will change over time. theres always gonna be someone you haven't talked to for a while, and that you miss. i guess i'll just accept that. i'm not gonna message them.</p>

     <p>spending a lot of time staring into my phone. been getting a couple hundred views on my sc story, and a while ago i reckon that would've made me pretty happy. i think maslow was on the right track with the whole hierachy of needs thing- a while ago i had people i could always talk to, people that always managed to make me happy. i think when you have that, you're able to appreciate materialistic, shallower things a lot more. i miss having my expensive shoes make me happy. my friends better pull through tomorrow with these lunch plans.</p>

     <p>got some great ramen today, learnt how relatively awful my spice tolerance is compared to some of my friends. always good talking music with someone who can vibe with some experimental shit. ended on a super high note in tactics.</p>
     
     <p>two really good albums: <i>Drive North</i> by <b>SWMRS</b> and <i>Zentropy</i> by <b>Frankie Cosmos</b> definitely loving the music i'm finding recently. should be able to find a way to make up some cassettes as well soon, so looking forward to that!</p>
