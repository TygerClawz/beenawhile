     <p>it's done! site should be working as intended now- s/o to the jazzy music customer service provided to me while i was tryna fix it.</p>
     
     <p>anyways, went out to get new figure skates today- they're tight but should wear in soon enough. they did music requests so i asked for <i>Best To You</i> by <b>Blood Orange</b>, getting to live out a small dream of mine on the ice- the one from that clairo video where  they're all on roller skates. next time i just hope somehow it'll happen with the lights off in the rink.</p>

     <p>lonely day- gave up on something, started something else. gonna look for cassettes and something to record onto them with in the next couple days. looking foward to making some mixtapes of my favourite songs/genres/artists. it'll be good to refine some of my huger playlists into just my faves. spent the better parts of my day talking to my favourite people- and driving the new car, figuring it out. the seat goes alll the way back so that's got potential!</p>
     
     <p>was also thinking about the name of this site. i think it's definitely talking about someone specifically, but i've got a hunch that person will change over time. theres always gonna be someone you haven't talked to for a while, and that you miss. i guess i'll just accept that. i'm not gonna message them.</p>

     <p>spending a lot of time staring into my phone. been getting a couple hundred views on my sc story, and a while ago i reckon that would've made me pretty happy. i think maslow was on the right track with the whole hierachy of needs thing- a while ago i had people i could always talk to, people that always managed to make me happy. i think when you have that, you're able to appreciate materialistic, shallower things a lot more. i miss having my expensive shoes make me happy. my friends better pull through tomorrow with these lunch plans.</p>

     <p>got some great ramen today, learnt how relatively awful my spice tolerance is compared to some of my friends. always good talking music with someone who can vibe with some experimental shit. ended on a super high note in tactics.</p>
     
     <p>two really good albums: <i>Drive North</i> by <b>SWMRS</b> and <i>Zentropy</i> by <b>Frankie Cosmos</b> definitely loving the music i'm finding recently. should be able to find a way to make up some cassettes as well soon, so looking forward to that!</p>

     <p>hmm, missed a day. realised today that i didn't deserve her when i was with her, but i've learnt from it, so i'll be better for the next person. life is a hell've a process i guess. some of the lessons seem to take ages, but i suppose those are the more worthwhile ones.</p>
     
     <p>thinking about that grouchy old supervisor makes me anxious, but fortunately schoolwork isn't making me anxious at the moment. i think i'll be able to manage these assignments, and as long as i get things done and just commit time to school work i should be good to coast next year.</p>

     <p>okay, busy week. unexpected shift tomorrow for seven hours. missing out on going out for burritos with the lads. could probably have gotten a lot done with school work... least i'll be getting paid</p>
     
     <p>i did something pretty wrong today, but i think it's gonna turn out okay. it was only morally wrong, and everyone involved was happy, so why bother getting too hung up on it? i'm not currently sure where i stand as far as moral ground goes on a lot of issues nowadays. i feel like investing large amounts of time an or thought into relatively pointless discussion will weigh me down in the long run. i'd rather just be happy as much of the time as i can be.</p>

     <p>oh! totally forgot something yesterday- these awesome dudes started up a convo with me about my sneakers on the street. it was great, they were really passionate about something that i've got a lot of interest in, and i don't really get to chat to people about it much. they gave me some sweet compliments on my newish red sneakers, and it was a great experience. i'm really glad there are people out there like those dudes.</p>
     
     <p>today was good too. had the best work shift all holidays, my supervisor said that i'd improved a lot, and i reckon she kinda likes me now. apparently she hates a lot of people. i've sent an email following up once again with pigeonhole, i wanna at least hear a reply from them, ideally get a job opportunity though! i've forgotten to put in my availability for the cinemas- so i'm not gonna get any shifts there for the next couple weeks now.</p>
     
     <p>i've found myself laughing at things a lot recently. i'm loving it. i'm not missing anything in life rn, and i'm happy. gonna go watch jackass or something.</p>

     <p>got to play the role of the sensible designated driver tonight, even though i was only driving for myself. school starts in two days, and i have so much work to do for it, but i really dont care, and not in the usual sad, empty nothing matters way- i'm really happy. it's in a carefree way, i've got really nice new music on rn, and things will all work themselves out. i'm confident of that.</p>
     
     <p>i hope you're going alright. you deserve to feel good each and every day.</p>

     <p>ugh school work is boring as fuck- first day back today, got to wear my new jordans which was a nice change from the crap shoes i had last year, (and the year before.) working on a psych assignment that doesnt mean much rn, got a philosophy test tomorrow about art- got a monologue for drama to learn as well.</p>
     
     <p>found another weird yellow tape thing with the obscene, poorly written messages on them. also almost broke my knee falling into some random hole out the front of the church at the top of my road. had my eyes closed whilst walking there and just fell right into it, my bag toppling over my head. good times.</p>

     <p>its super nice making new friends. finished all my assignments, just gotta memorise my monologue real quick. i'm moving on from some things, some people. i don't think i'll forget them, but they won't have to affect me much anymore. looking forward to winning pool against her soon.</p>
     
     <p>i don't know how to feel about this person. they're meant to be my friend and all, but i just don't see us being actual friends. i would hate to lose them though, because they know so many other people i genuinely like. i'm not sure if this is manipulative or not, but i just don't know how else to handle it. i just wish we could accept our relationship for what it is, and not have to be besties for some reason.</p>
